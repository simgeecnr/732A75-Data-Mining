# Advanced Data Mining Labs

Welcome to the Data Mining Lab Projects repository! These projects were completed as part of the coursework for the Data Mining (732A75) course at Link√∂ping University. Each project serves as a homework assignment, providing practical experience and understanding in various data mining techniques, with analysis performed using Weka

## Projects

**1) Clustering Lab:** Project 1 focuses on exploring the "food.arff" dataset provided, performing descriptive statistics, and visualizing the data to gain initial insights. Additionally, simple k-means clustering and density-based clustering techniques are applied to identify natural groupings within the data. <br />

**2) Association Analysis Lab 1:** Project 2 focuses on the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in the field of machine learning. The goal is to apply classification algorithms to predict the class labels of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. In this project, the Apriori algorithm is used from Weka to derive association rules from the dataset and interpret the discovered rules. <br />

**3) Association Analysis Lab 2:** Project 3 involves the Monk1 dataset, which is known to exhibit challenges when using clustering algorithms. Instead of clustering, we leverage association rule mining techniques to extract meaningful patterns and rules from the dataset. Specifically, we aim to derive association rules that help determine the classes within the Monk1 dataset. Four rules are identified to aid in class determination. <br />
